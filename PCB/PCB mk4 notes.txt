* silk screen for labeling not showing
* level shifter needs to be the TXS0104EDR
* power switch needs pull down resistor
* op amp needs 12v power. only on when power switch is hit
* make connectors different for led data lines
* make sure fuse blows when crowbar circuit is active
* change diodes / thyristor circuit to actually work
* ground clamp test point (looping test point)
* bat test point messed up
* make components assemblable by jlcpcb
* better pin 1 markings
* bottom pad on mpu6050 doesnt exist
* add 10k pull up resistors to encoder data pins
