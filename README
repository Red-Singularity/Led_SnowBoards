The goal of this repository is to share code between all members who have custom LED snowbnoards to expedite the process of getting to the slopes
with actually functioning snowboards

This will not only include the code used on the boards but also possible testbeds, images, and other related files
This will be compartmentalized between users as all boards are built differently and require different code
this will allow merges to go a lot smoother since ideally only the user who created the code commited here will be modifying it
This also allows other people to view and test other members code though
